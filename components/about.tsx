        <p>
          I started coding because I was curious about how websites and apps work. What began as small experiments with
          <span className="font-bold"> JavaScript and React </span>
          soon grew into a passion for building complete projects. I learned
          <span className="font-bold"> Node.js, Express, </span>
          and databases like
          <span className="font-bold"> MongoDB and PostgreSQL </span>
          to handle the backend and make my applications more useful and reliable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, I worked on projects where I optimized APIs, organized code, and built systems that are easy to
          maintain. I enjoy connecting the frontend and backend, creating projects that are smooth, functional, and
          enjoyable for users.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond coding, I write blogs to share what I learnâ€”from project tips to insights about development. For me,
          coding is more than writing lines of code; it's about solving problems, learning constantly, and creating
          software that makes a difference.
